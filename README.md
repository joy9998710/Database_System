# Database_System

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

The projects shown in this repository aim to deepen understanding of **Database Systems** through practical implementation at various levels â€” from front-end application development to low-level storage engine design.

- ðŸ§ª **Lab 01 â€“ Web-Based Stock Database**  
  Implemented a stock information website by designing a MySQL database and integrating it with a local Javascript front-end. (plus Node.js) This lab focused on connecting databases to web interfaces and understanding client-server interactions in a local environment.

- ðŸ§ª **Lab 02 â€“ Disk-Based B+ Tree Implementation**  
  Developed a B+ tree using the C programming language with disk-based storage. This lab provided insights into how data is managed at the storage level in real-world database engines, including paging and node management.

- ðŸ§ª **Lab 03 â€“ Natural Join on B+ Tree**  
  Extended the implementation from Lab 02 by adding support for the **Natural Join** operation. This lab simulated how relational operators are processed internally by low-level storage systems, contributing to a clearer understanding of query execution mechanisms.
